# High Performing and Easy to Maintain

ETM Websites is testing the limits of high-performing websites that are both easy-to-maintain for the site owner and extremely affordable. Do you have revenues over $1,000,000 but don't think you can afford a clean, modern website that is focused on generating leads and educating your customer? Think again.

## Extremely Affordable

For $5,000, ETM can deliver just that. All we need from you is a 50% deposit and the brand colors.

The US Small Business Administration recommends, "As a general rule, small businesses with revenues less than $5M should allocate 7-8% of their revenues to marketing - based on companies that have margins in the 10-12% range. Even if you're only making $1M per year, that's $70-80K for marketing. $5,000 for a brand new, cutting edge website is a drop in the bucket.

## We're not an "Agency"

What makes us different than anyone else out there slinging websites? Plenty.

* Easy to work with. We'll never try to upsell you on anything. Our bread and butter is high-performing, easy-to-maintain websites that require absolutely no additional services from us once the product is launched. No monthly bill. Nada.
* In our previous work on the traditional agency side, we've designed and built websites for global brands such as Toyota, Woodford Reserve, Hilliard Lyons, Fireking Security Group, and more. Those were not cheap websites. We know what we're doing, and our technical architecture is second to none - it's why we can do what we do for so little. We have a streamlined process and platform built to quickly create websites with top shelf performance.
* We're NOT an agency. We started ETM because we identified a niche market: companies that do NOT want an ongoing relationship with any agency. They just want a website. So here we are. Recurring revenue is great, but we don't have any. We bust our tails to get new business every day. Because we're not an agency with recurring revenues.
